# ShapleyLorenz

### IN PROGRESS

Algorithm that computes Shapley-Lorenz contribution coefficients, inspired by the paper "Shapley-Lorenz decompositions in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence", by Paolo Giudici and Emanuela Raffinetti from February 2020.

TODO:
- insert method for normalising features, so as to account for negative values
- add possibility to use for classification problems


# Example plots

Plot of Lorenz Curves for simulation data set with three features and normally distributed features and error term:
